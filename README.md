## ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.0
- pip
- Docker & Docker Compose

---

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>


2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

  
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Configure environment variables:**
  
  Create a .env file in the project root directory.
  (To run docker-compose create also .env.docker) 
  
  Add the following environment variables:
  
  DATABASE_URL: Connection string for the MySQL database.
  
  REDIS_HOST: Hostname or IP address of the Redis server.
  
  REDIS_PORT: Port number of the Redis server.
  
  SECRET_KEY =  String/+Int for Encryption
  
  BASE_URL = "http://web:8000"


  ## API Keys

Before running the application, you need to obtain an OpenAI API key and configure it in your environment.

 

**Set the API Key Environment Variable:**

   - **Option 1: Using Environment Variables:**
      - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
      - Add the following line to the `.env` file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY =<your_api_key>
        ```
        - Replace `<your_api_key>` with your actual GEMINI API API key.

   - **Option 2: Setting Environment Variable Directly (Not Recommended for Production):**
      - Set the environment variable directly in your terminal:
        ```bash
        export GEMINI_API_KEY =<your_api_key> 
        ```
      - **Note:** This method is not recommended for production as it exposes your API key directly in your shell history.

  
      
  ## Running the Application
     
  **Start the Docker containers with all at once:**

        docker-compose up -d --build
   
       
  **Run the FastAPI application:**

     uvicorn main:app --reload 
    
  **Run the Streamlit UI:**
    
     streamlit run ui/Home.py
